/*
  # Create tasks table with authentication support

  1. New Tables
    - `tasks`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to auth.users)
      - `title` (text)
      - `description` (text)
      - `completed` (boolean)
      - `due_date` (timestamptz)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `tasks` table
    - Add policies for authenticated users to:
      - Read their own tasks
      - Create new tasks
      - Update their own tasks
      - Delete their own tasks
